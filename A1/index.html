										<p>Salutations! My name is Jack Philip Burgess, and I am a 21-year-old Australian male. Although my father is Australian, dating all the way back to his ancestors, my mother is British making me the lesser fifty-fifty between the two.</p>

										<h3>Entertainment</h3>
										<p>IT is in almost everything we use, from cars, to fridges, to phones to video games. So, in a way, I guess I have always been interested in IT. When I was in kindergarten and primary school, I passed my time lounging in front of the television. Had some sports I did ad school, but outside of that, with no friends to run around and play with, I was just admiring the technological advancement which is Foxtel and digital television with my father. My father used to have a PlayStation and still has his PC that I used to frequently play when I was bored. Games like Spyro, Crash Bandicoot, GTA Vice City and even Solitaire, Minesweeper and Pinball. In primary school I got my first gaming console, an Xbox 360, and would spend a lot of time playing on that by myself, with my brother or my cousin, mostly WWE.</p>

										<h3>Listen2Learners</h3>
										<p>But I guess the first actual time I was interested in technology as more than just something to mindlessly pass the time, would be in grade 5. At this point my school had introduced laptops and tablets for us to learn on, keep and showed us all sorts of things we could do on them. We made animations, music, movies, wrote assignments and even did some programming on them. It was at this point that an annual student-focussed collaboration was introduced to me called Listen2Learners. A teacher escorted 4 students, including myself, to a weekend-long technology fair in Melbourne that showcased the works of all sorts of students from Primary and Secondary Schools all around the nation.</p>

									<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
									<p>My ideal job would be one where I am able to push myself and indulge 100% into what I am doing and reap greater rewards for greater performance. Where the atmosphere is a combination of serious work and fun where you become mates with the people you work with and for. One with a stable income and a stable routine or guide to follow to keep me involved.</p>

										<p>I feel that I have found it within this advertisement posted on seek.com.au by EB Games, a leading retailer in the Australian video game industry. This position offers a 12-month full-time contract within an industry, and store, that I have loved since early childhood. It recognises and rewards performance with a fun and dynamic culture. And even if I feel the need to change or upgrade from here, it comes with endless career opportunities across EB Games and Zing Pop Culture. The contract entails the analysis of the ever-changing shopping, gaming, and pop culture trends, and following them to develop, test, debug, maintain and document programs and applications to further progress the company.</p>

												<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
											</header>
											<p>The Myers-Briggs test states that I am a logical person, more likely and willing to follow a rational, methodical approach to reach my goal with a set out plan, rather than spontaneously winging what I am doing when I get sudden bursts of energy. It also means that I am more focused on getting the job done and what is required, rather than how I or others feel. Being a tactile learner means that I benefit greatly from hands-on learning and creating rather than listening or getting shown something happening. Having my team roles set as an explorer, innovator, analyst and expert, states that I am someone who likes to come up with new, original ideas, work through them my own way, criticise my work and others and get frustrated if someone else tries to take over their way.</p>

										<h2>Project Idea</h2>
									</header>
									<p>My project idea is a long distance, self-training, automated ball thrower for dogs. An automated device in which a dog, or person, puts a rubber ball into a feeder. The system would then output a biscuit, or some other form of treat, so the dog is rewarded for returning the ball and is trained to do so. It would then feed the ball into a chamber that would launch the ball with changeable speed and trajectory for different environments.</p>
