								<p>These results show that I will probably be quite stubborn and inconsiderate with ideas and group members. However, if a plan is shown to rationally be the best choice will analyse and think ahead of how it will work, and work required for it. It also means that others trying to describe their ideas will have a better chance at getting me to understand and visualise their thoughts with a more hands-on approach, like a model or working through the problem to solution with me. My experience with my own stubbornness and need to control the group direction, leads me to be more reserved and give my hand as a helper or someone who thinks about ways to improve others initial ideas. However, if I feel that the task being undertaken would be better suited to me completing it alone with a different idea or approach, it will make me get a little frustrated and can lead to a debate starting if someone has strong opinions against my own and we cannot see eye-to-eye.</p>
								<p>I should take this into consideration when forming the team by getting to know my fellow group members and designating a leader of the project whose path everyone is okay to follow and build upon and is well respected by the entire group. Trying to avoid any other stubborn people as it could lead to a lot of discourse. Having someone more compassionate to act a team moderator when things get a little heated, taking everyones views into account and finding a solution that is best for everyone involved, not just a few members. It is also important to find someone with good organisational and scheduling skills to make sure the project runs smoothly, start to finish, and everyone has goals and times to reach that is manageable and they are pleased with. Making sure every member can share at least 2-3 hours a week for a catch up, collaborative work and plans moving forward is also key.</p>
