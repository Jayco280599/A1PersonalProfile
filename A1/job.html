									<p>I am already on the right path for this role as I believe I am a fast learner with quick problem-solving skills. My passion for latest technology and gaming related trends is also prominent with most of my spare time being used on social media and streaming platforms watching people play a large variety of games on different platforms and different ways, from competitively speed running a game from 30 years ago, to beating the current favourite game with a ridiculous device, to people just messing around with friends and on their own to enjoy the game. I also have around 3 years of HTML and CSS experience from high school and have designed, developed, tested, debugged and document numerous of my own websites, and was the head beta tester for a new indie company trying to create their first game. During my time in high school, I have also completed a few projects using Visual Studio and throughout all my studies have done collaborative work on designs, development, programming, and documentation, primary to tertiary. My time developing robots and programs from scratch in high school and University has given me experience in an agile development environment, test driven development and continuous integration. The pub I work at currently has its own loyalty system, shared between 2 different places of business, and although I was not there for the development of it, I do know the system, how it works and how it runs.</p>
									<p>I am currently learning JavaScript and delving into GIT with my studies, and after these introductory courses can begin my real goal of starting and completing a 3-year computing, design, development, and programming course at RMIT. At the conclusion of these 3 years, I hope to either have a position, as a junior in training, in an industry that can give me experience towards my ideal job or be a freelance programmer as I search for a job offer that can progress me. If in the 3 years at RMIT they do not touch on all the information and skills required for this role, I will spend time after my studies, as a freelance programmer, to find and complete courses to gain the knowledge I am lacking. My freelance work will most likely be done through Fiverr, LinkedIn and other such platforms that allow me to spread who I am, what I know and what I can do to as many people looking to hire someone as possible and trying to do a quick, efficient, and exceptional job, completing all their required points, and divulging their personal thoughts as much as I can to receive high ratings and recommendations.<p>
