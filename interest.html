								<p>IT is in almost everything we use, from cars, to fridges, to phones to video games. So, in a way, I guess I have always been interested in IT. When I was in kindergarten and primary school, I passed my time lounging in front of the television. Had some sports I did ad school, but outside of that, with no friends to run around and play with, I was just admiring the technological advancement which is Foxtel and digital television with my father. My father used to have a PlayStation and still has his PC that I used to frequently play when I was bored. Games like Spyro, Crash Bandicoot, GTA Vice City and even Solitaire, Minesweeper and Pinball. In primary school I got my first gaming console, an Xbox 360, and would spend a lot of time playing on that by myself, with my brother or my cousin, mostly WWE.</p>
								<p>But I guess the first actual time I was interested in technology as more than just something to mindlessly pass the time, would be in grade 5. At this point my school had introduced laptops and tablets for us to learn on, keep and showed us all sorts of things we could do on them. We made animations, music, movies, wrote assignments and even did some programming on them. It was at this point that an annual student-focussed collaboration was introduced to me called Listen2Learners. A teacher escorted 4 students, including myself, to a weekend-long technology fair in Melbourne that showcased the works of all sorts of students from Primary and Secondary Schools all around the nation.</p>
								<p>It was at this point I realised how fascinated I was with IT and how much fun I could have with it. After this I did numerous programming courses for languages like Python, C++, CSS, PHP, HTML, Arduino, Lego Technic, etc. and competed in world-wide programming competitions where I consistently managed to finish in the top 10%. I have also made a few animations and short movies to showcase my creative side and have been commissioned to do video editing for some Twitch streamers and Youtubers. During my early education I was also part of and co-head of the student-lead tech-help team, where students would bring their tech problems to us to try and solve before it went on to the real tech-support. I may or may not have also remotely accessed a few of my friends laptops and play some little pranks like changing their cursor or putting their laptop to sleep.</p>
								<p>I chose RMIT because whilst looking around for a University to study Engineering at, I remembered how forward and the high standing RMIT has in tertiary and extended study of technology. I even applied to undertake Engineering there but was declined and resorted to Deakin instead. However, after dropping out of that course, after 2 years, I noticed a computer design, development, and programming course that I could apply for and complete online, and decided it was the perfect course for what I was looking for then.</p>
								<p>In my studies, I hope and expect to learn more about the IT world, how it functions and where I can fit into it. I also hope to gain a better understanding of myself, not just my strengths and weaknesses, but what area of work, study and living I enjoy most and find a goal that I want to work towards and put everything I have into achieving and exceeding.</p>
